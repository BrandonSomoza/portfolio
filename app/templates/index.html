                <p>She sat down with her notebook in her hand, her mind wandering to faraway places. 
                    She paused and considered all that had happened. 
                    It hadn't gone as expected. 
                    When the day began she thought it was going to be a bad one, 
                    but as she sat recalling the day's events to write them down, 
                    she had to admit, it had been a rather marvelous day.</p>

                <p>She had been told time and time again that the most important steps were the first and the last. 
                    It was something that she carried within her in everything she did, but then he showed up and disrupted everything. 
                    He told her that she had it wrong. 
                    The first step wasn't the most important. The last step wasn't the most important. 
                    It was the next step that was the most important.</p>

                <p>"It's never good to give them details," Janice told her sister. "Always be a little vague and keep them guessing." 
                    Her sister listened intently and nodded in agreement. 
                    She didn't fully understand what her sister was saying but that didn't matter. 
                    She loved her so much that she would have agreed to whatever came out of her mouth.</p>
